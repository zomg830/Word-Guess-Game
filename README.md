#Homework Assignment 3: JavaScript Hangman!

## Overview

In this assignment, I created a "Word Guess" game similar to the classic game "Hangman". This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

### Word Guess Game

* The theme of this game is based off of the book and television series, "The Expanse". Written by authors Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham under the pen-name James S.A. Corey, "The Expanse" is one of my favorite fictional universes.

* Set in the future of the 24th Century, the story follows James Holden and his crew as they fight for survival and become entangled in web after web of political intrigue and nefarious corporate experimentation.
