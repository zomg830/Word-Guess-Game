#Homework Assignment 3: JavaScript Hangman!

## Overview

In this assignment, I created a "Word Guess" game similar to the classic game "Hangman". This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

### Word Guess Game

* The theme of this game is based off of the book and television series, "The Expanse". Written by authors Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham under the pen-name James S.A. Corey, "The Expanse" is one of my favorite fictional universes.

* Set in the future of the 24th Century, the story follows James Holden and his crew as they fight for survival and become entangled in web after web of political intrigue and nefarious corporate experimentation.

### How to Play

* To play the game, simply load the web page and begin typing to guess the word. Use the hint as a guideline and if you have no background in The Expanse lore, feel free to check out the [wiki page](http://expanse.wikia.com/wiki/The_Expanse_Wiki).

* If you don't guess the correct answer by exhausting your remaining guesses, the web page will reset and another random word and hint will be generated. If you successfully guess the answer, an image and link to the wiki will be generated, click the reset button to clear the character image + wiki link and generate another answer.

* After a answer has been used once it will not appear again in the same game session. Refreshing the page will refresh the answer bank but also reset your wins. Try to get as high of a score as possible in the same game session!

* There is no need to include spaces in your guesses, and all guesses are strictly alphabet characters. Attempting to use punctuation or letters will lead to some... interesting results being displayed in the "Incorrect Guesses" field.

### Credits and Acknowledgements

* I would like to thank the instructors and TAs at The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin for introducing me to the concepts and knowledge needed to create this game. Google, w3schools.com, and Mozilla MDN also deserve honorable mentions.
